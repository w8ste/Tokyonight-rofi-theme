### Prerequisites

My rofi setup requires you to have some kind of [Nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) installed. In case 
you would like my setup without having to install a nerdfont, just comment out lines 10-12 in my [config.rasi](https://github.com/w8ste/Tokyonight-rofi-theme/blob/main/config.rasi). 

### Installation

Run the following commands:

```
  mv ~/.config/rofi ~/.config/rofi.bak
  git clone git@github.com:w8ste/Tokyonight-rofi-theme.git ~/.config/rofi
  sudo mv ~/.config/rofi/tokyonight.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes
  sudo mv ~/.config/rofi/tokyonight_big1.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes
  sudo mv ~/.config/rofi/tokyonight_big2.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes
  rm ~/.config/rofi/README.md
```

Afterwards you can select the version, that you want via the rofi-theme-selector. In case you do not want all
of the versions: only `mv` the ones that you want into `/usr/share/rofi/themes` and `rm ~/.config/rofi/"version"`the other ones.
It may be possible that you need to reaload your .config files (e.g. $mod + shift + r for i3), even though
this never occured when i was testing.

### Alternative installation
In case you prefer to install just the theme without my configuration of rofi, you run the following commands:
```
  git clone git@github.com:w8ste/Tokyonight-rofi-theme.git ~/tokyonight
  sudo mv ~/tokyonight/tokyonight.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes
  sudo mv ~/.config/rofi/tokyonight_big1.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes
  sudo mv ~/.config/rofi/tokyonight_big2.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes
  rm -rf ~/tokyonight
```
